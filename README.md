# picosdk-c-wrappers

*picosdk-c-wrappers* is a set of C wrapper library projects for PicoScope oscilloscopes.

The wrapper functions provided by the wrapper libraries are for use with programming languages such as MathWorks MATLAB, National Instruments LabVIEW
and Microsoft Excel VBA that do not support features of the C programming language such as callback functions. The source code contained in the wrapper projects contains a description of the functions and the input and output parameters.

The wrapper projects are for Microsoft Windows platforms and are grouped by driver. The source code files may be customised for projects, and also used for building wrapper libraries for Linux and macOS platforms. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

#### Microsoft Windows

* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (including Express and Community editions) or later. 

#### Linux
